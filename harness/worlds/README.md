# Low-level engine fixtures

Application acceptance uses the [YAML scenarios](../acceptance/workloads/) with
`seedbox run` / `seedbox replay`. Faults, workloads and verification run in their
guest drivers. Seed sweeps are ordinary CLI loops.

## Removed application paths

| Removed definition | Replacement |
| --- | --- |
| `etcd1.json`, `guest/etcd1.init` | Removed obsolete single-member boot fixture; use the etcd Compose example |
| `cluster.json` | [etcd Compose example](../../examples/etcd/compose.yaml) |
| `kill-3.5.2.json`, `short-kill-3.5.2.json` | [etcd 3.5.2 scenario](../acceptance/workloads/short-kill-3.5.2.yaml) |
| `kill-3.5.3.json` | [etcd 3.5.3 scenario](../acceptance/workloads/kill-3.5.3.yaml) |
| `sanity.json` | [planted-failure control](../acceptance/workloads/sanity.yaml) |
| `race.json`, `guest/race.init` | [race scenario](../acceptance/workloads/race.yaml), using the existing C workload |
| `campaign.sh`, `campaign-result.py` and their tests | `seedbox run` exit status, retained reports, and CLI seed loops |

These replace the application acceptance workflow; they do not preserve the old
serial fault schedule, witnesses or historical failing seeds. The removed files
from this cleanup are available in Git at `c7d7c22`. Historical research records at commit `788fc43` retain their original references
and identities.

## Remaining fixtures and dependencies

| Definition | Why it remains |
| --- | --- |
| `smoke.json`, `net.json` | Raw kernel boot/timer/entropy and virtual NIC checks |
| `cluster-fixed.json`, `single-vm*.json` | Matched multi-VM versus one-VM network-namespace experiments; Compose uses one service per VM |

`batch.sh`, `batch.py` and `msr54.py` still run these fixtures with shared CPU/SMT
leases and verified MSR restoration. Runtime lifecycle tests also use their CPU
topology/readback helpers. `guest/build-netns.sh` still needs `build-client.sh`,
`build-initramfs.sh`, `cluster.init`, `single.init`, `network.sh`, `members.sh`,
`netprobe.c` and `sbx.c` for the one-VM/multi-VM comparison. The raw boot/network
fixtures use the same initramfs builder. These dependencies are not replaced by
the application YAML scenarios.

See the [one-VM fixture instructions](../../README.md#one-vm-network-fixture) for
building and running those experiments. Use the [runtime fault API](../../python/README.md)
for new application scenarios.
